# Progress

Tracks what's working, what's left, current status, and known issues.

## What Works

- **Workspace Setup:** 
  - NPM workspace initialized with shared dependencies
  - Project-wide build scripts added to streamline development

- **`@yacoin/core` Package:**
    - Basic structure created (`src/`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`)
    - Build configured with `esbuild` (`esbuild.config.ts`) and runnable via `tsx`
    - Core types defined (`Block`, `Transaction`, `TxIn`, `TxOut` in `src/types/`)
    - Blockchain utilities:
        - Block hashing (`calculateBlockHash` in `src/blockchain/blockUtils.ts`)
        - Genesis block creation (`createGenesisBlock` in `src/blockchain/genesis.ts`)
        - Basic Proof-of-Work mining (`mineBlock`, `hashMatchesDifficulty` in `src/blockchain/mining.ts`)
    - Chain representation and management:
        - Blockchain array initialized with genesis block
        - Functions to add validated blocks (`addBlock`)
        - Helper functions for accessing blockchain data (`getLatestBlock`, `getBlockchain`)
    - Block & chain validation functions implemented
    - Transaction system:
        - Transaction types defined using TypeScript types
        - Transaction creation with change output and real signatures
        - Transaction validation for both structure and semantics
        - UTXO model enhanced with public key storage
        - Transaction pool implementation for unconfirmed transactions
        - Signature verification interface for dependency inversion

- **`@yacoin/wallet` Package:**
    - Key pair generation using secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography
    - Wallet address creation using SHA-256 + RIPEMD-160 hashing
    - Digital signatures for transactions
    - Signature verification utilities
    - Signature verifier registration with core package

- **`@yacoin/examples` Package:**
    - Wallet integration test demonstrating:
      - Wallet creation
      - Transaction creation with real cryptographic signatures
      - Signature verification
      - Testing invalid signatures
    - Transaction pool demo showing:
      - Adding valid transactions
      - Rejecting duplicate transactions
      - Preventing double spending
      - Removing transactions when included in blocks

## What's Left to Build

- **Core Functionality:**
  - Mining reward mechanism (coinbase transactions)
  - Mining difficulty adjustment
  - Network layer (P2P communication)
  - Persistent storage for the blockchain
  - API/CLI for interaction

- **Quality Improvements:**
  - Unit tests for all critical functions
  - Better error handling and logging
  - Security audits
  - Documentation

## Current Status

- The core blockchain data structures and validation logic are implemented
- Transaction creation and validation are working with real cryptographic signatures
- UTXO tracking includes public keys for proper signature verification
- A transaction pool manages unconfirmed transactions with double-spend prevention
- Architecture has been improved with proper dependency direction (core doesn't depend on wallet)
- Performance optimizations in place for transaction pool operations

## Known Issues/TODOs

- No coinbase transaction implementation yet for mining rewards
- Mining difficulty is currently static
- No network layer implementation
- No persistence layer
