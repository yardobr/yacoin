# Progress

Tracks what's working, what's left, current status, and known issues.

## What Works

- **Workspace Setup:** NPM workspace initialized.
- **`@yacoin/core` Package:**
    - Basic structure created (`src/`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`).
    - Build configured with `esbuild` (`esbuild.config.ts`) and runnable via `tsx`.
    - Core types defined (`Block`, `Transaction`, `TxIn`, `TxOut` in `src/types/`).
    - Blockchain utilities:
        - Block hashing (`calculateBlockHash` in `src/blockchain/blockUtils.ts`).
        - Genesis block creation (`createGenesisBlock` in `src/blockchain/genesis.ts`).
        - Basic Proof-of-Work mining (`mineBlock`, `hashMatchesDifficulty` in `src/blockchain/mining.ts`).
    - **Chain Representation:** Blockchain array initialized with genesis block (`blockchain` in `src/blockchain/chain.ts`).
    - **Block & Chain Validation:** Core validation functions implemented (`isValidBlockStructure`, `isValidNewBlock`, `isValidChain` in `src/blockchain/validation.ts`).

## What's Left to Build (High Level - see activeContext.md for details)

- Transaction creation and validation.
- Adding new blocks to the chain (including mining integration).
- Wallet/key management (generation, signing, verification).
- Mining difficulty adjustment.
- Transaction pool implementation.
- Network layer (P2P communication).
- Persistent storage.
- API/CLI for interaction.

## Current Status

- Core data structures for blocks and transactions are defined.
- Basic block creation (genesis) and mining functions exist.
- The blockchain is represented as an in-memory array.
- Essential validation logic for individual blocks and the overall chain integrity is implemented.
- The next major steps involve implementing transaction handling and the process of adding new, validated blocks to the chain.

## Known Issues/TODOs

- Transaction validation logic is minimal (needs signature checks, etc.).
- Mining difficulty is currently static.
- Proof-of-Work validation in `validation.ts` uses the block's own difficulty; needs integration with dynamic difficulty adjustment logic later.
- No wallet implementation yet.
- No network layer.
- No persistence.
