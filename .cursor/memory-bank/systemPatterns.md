- Architecture: Modular design with 5 core components
- Component 1: Core Blockchain Module - blocks, chain validation, PoW algorithm
- Component 2: Transaction System - UTXO model, transaction validation, mempool
- Component 3: Wallet Module - key management, addresses, transaction signing
- Component 4: P2P Network Layer - node discovery, blockchain sync, transaction broadcasting
- Component 5: CLI/API Interface - user commands and control
- Implementation order: Start with core blockchain, then transactions, wallet, P2P, and finally CLI
