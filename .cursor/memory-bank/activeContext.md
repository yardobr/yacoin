# Active Context

This file tracks the immediate focus, recent changes, and next steps for the YaCoin project.

## Current Focus

The current focus is on implementing the remaining core cryptocurrency functionality, specifically focusing on mining difficulty adjustment, network layer, and persistent storage.

## Recent Changes (Last Session)

- Integrated mining rewards into the core blockchain:
  - Implemented Bitcoin-like block reward calculation with halving every 210,000 blocks
  - Modified `mineBlock` function to automatically include coinbase transactions 
  - Created `mineBlockAndAddToChain` function that handles adding delays between blocks
  - Ensured proper timestamp validation between blocks by adding a delay
  - Added binary-based difficulty checking for proof-of-work validation
  - Fixed validation to properly verify coinbase transactions in blocks
  
- Enhanced the block validation system:
  - Added specialized coinbase transaction validation logic
  - Implemented reward amount validation based on block height
  - Ensured consistent difficulty validation between mining and validation code
  - Created tests for mining rewards functionality

- Developed a comprehensive demo showing mining rewards in action:
  - Created `mining-rewards-integrated.ts` example
  - Demonstrated block mining with multiple miners
  - Displayed automatic coinbase transaction inclusion
  - Showed reward halving at different block heights
  - Fixed binary hash validation to ensure consistent difficulty checking

- Previous session accomplishments:
  - Improved the UTXO model to store public keys
  - Integrated wallet signature verification into core transaction validation
  - Implemented a transaction pool for unconfirmed transactions
  - Fixed architectural issues with dependency inversion

## Next Steps

1. **Mining Reward Mechanism:**
   - ✅ Created coinbase transaction structure in `packages/core/src/types/coinbase.ts`
   - ✅ Implemented coinbase transaction creation and validation in `packages/core/src/transaction/coinbase.ts`
   - ✅ Implemented mining rewards calculation with Bitcoin-like halving approach in example files
   - ✅ Integrated mining rewards with core block creation process
   - ✅ Updated mining functions to automatically include coinbase transactions

2. **Difficulty Adjustment:**
   - Implement logic to adjust the mining `difficulty` based on block generation time
   - Add time-based rules to ensure steady block production

3. **Network Layer:**
   - Design and implement the P2P network protocol
   - Add node discovery and blockchain synchronization
   - Create transaction broadcasting functionality

4. **Storage Implementation:**
   - Design a persistent storage solution for the blockchain
   - Create serialization/deserialization methods for blocks and transactions
   - Implement database operations for saving and loading the chain

5. **CLI/API Interface:**
   - Create command-line tools for node operations
   - Add wallet management commands
   - Implement transaction creation/mining commands

## Active Decisions/Considerations

- Using dependency inversion for crypto functionality to maintain proper package dependencies
- Optimizing data structures for performance (Sets for transaction pool validation)
- Maintaining proper package separation: core should not depend on higher-level packages
- Using registration pattern for connecting wallet functionality to core
- Following functional programming principles for all code
- All types defined using `type` (not `interface`)
- Added async/await pattern for block mining to support delays between block generation
- Using binary hash checking for difficulty validation to ensure proper proof-of-work

# Open questions: Specific P2P protocol details, storage implementation details, optimal difficulty adjustment algorithm.
# Next steps: 
  1. Implement difficulty adjustment based on block generation time.
  2. Design and implement the P2P network layer.
