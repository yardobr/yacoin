# Code Style and Structure

1. **Functional Programming Only**
   - Use functions and plain objects, no classes
   - Use TypeScript `type` declarations, not `interfaces`
   - Prefer immutable data structures and pure functions

2. **Module Structure**
   - Keep files small and focused on a single responsibility
   - Use barrel exports (index.ts) for cleaner imports
   - Group related functionality in directories

3. **Imports and Exports**
   - Use named exports/imports rather than default exports
   - When importing from other packages, reference the package, not relative paths
   - Use CommonJS module system throughout the project
   - No need to include file extensions in imports
